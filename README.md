# Anti-Asian-Hate_Trend_Analysis
## Aims to analyze the #stopasianhate movement on Twitter and spread the awareness of anti-racism hate.

In the spring of 2020, around the same time as COVID-19 started to spread in the United States, the AAPI Equity Alliance office in San Francisco started noticing a concerning trend. Increasingly, they were hearing from friends, colleagues, and news reports about a spike in anti-Asian incidents. It’s undeniable that the pandemic and anti-Asian racism have left a deep scar on the Asian community since then.

This project will focus on analyzing 3 key incidents that happened after 2020 and are related to anti-Asian racism:
  1. Donald Trump’s public statement about the “Chinese Virus” in 2020
  2. The Atlantic Shooting in 2021
  3. New York Subway Shoving Attack in 2022

This project will analyze the public sentiment on social media, public perception of these extreme racial discrimination events, and will further analyze the trend of the movement of the anti-Asian-hate on Twitter across the years. All of the data used in this analysis were scrapped from Twitter but the scrapping keywords and time range might vary among topics.
